# Asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)

If you want to build projects efficiently, then this concept is for you.
The theory of async JavaScript helps you break down big complex projects into smaller tasks.
Then you can use any of these three techniques – callbacks, promises or Async/await – to run those small tasks in a way that you get the best results.
Let's dive in!

## Synchronous Vs Asynchronous system

JavaScript is by default Synchronous

### What is a Synchronous System?

In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another. step by step you cant jump over steps.
For example, you have 1 hand and 5 tasks to do, you will go one by one, you can't go from step 1 to step 3 directly but you have to take step 2 first

### What is an Asynchronous System?

In this system, tasks are completed independently.
For example, you have 5 hand and 5 tasks to do.
So, each hand can do each task independently and at the same time.
